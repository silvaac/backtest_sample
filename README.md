# backtest_sample

<!-- WARNING: THIS FILE WAS AUTOGENERATED! DO NOT EDIT! -->

This is a simple illustration of how to build a flexible backtesting
environment. Different models can be added by adding new classes to
folders, er, risk, pm, and tc. A general interface (data_interface.py)
can be used to call these different models, making it easy to change
them. The actual backtest loop is performend by the backtest memeber
function within backtest_loop.py.

The code is basic, lacks tests, and was not extensively debugged. I
intended to present a toy program that introduces the basic backtesting
features. Substantial work remains to produce a fully functional
backtesting infrastructure.

A parameter optimization infrastructure is the most substantial feature
that needs to be added. This can be added within the backtest loop to
optimize only using past data, and I intend to add it in the future.

One final observation: the data schema is fundamental for such a
program. I assume we are downloading Yahoo Finance’s data (“OHLCAV”).
Throughout the code, this data convention is used without further
checks. This is something that needs to be addressed in professional
backtest code.

## Developer Guide

If you are new to using `nbdev` here are some useful pointers to get you
started.

### Install backtest_sample in Development mode

``` sh
# make sure backtest_sample package is installed in development mode
$ pip install -e .

# make changes under nbs/ directory
# ...

# compile to have changes apply to backtest_sample
$ nbdev_prepare
```

## Usage

### Installation

Install latest from the GitHub
[repository](https://github.com/silvaac/backtest_sample):

``` sh
$ pip install git+https://github.com/silvaac/backtest_sample.git
```

### Documentation

Documentation can be found hosted on this GitHub
[repository](https://github.com/silvaac/backtest_sample)’s
[pages](https://www.idatafactory.com/backtest_sample/).

## How to use

### Get data

You can only get data from yahoo finance at the moment.

``` python
import_module = get_data()
df = import_module('BTC-USD').sim_data()
print(df.tail())
```

### Parameters

Select the parameters of the backtest and the model.

``` python
# parameters
prm = {}
## General parameters
prm['when_trade'] = 'open' # when to trade
prm['start_date'] = 100    # how many periods (days here) to skip before trading
## ER model
prm['er_member_func'] = get_er() # Select the model class
# ER model parameters (see model for detail)
prm['mawin'] = 10
prm['sdwin'] = 30
## Risk model
prm['risk_member_func'] = get_risk() # Select the model class
# Risk model parameter (see model for detail)
prm['wvol']  = 60
## PM allocation model
prm['pm_member_func'] = get_pm() # Select the model class
# PM parameters (see model for detail)
prm['target_vol'] = 0.005 # target volatility per backtesting step (daily here)
prm['AUM'] = 10e6  # Investment capital in the currency of the data ($ here)
## TC model parameters
prm['tc_member_func'] = get_tc() # Select the model class
# TC parameters (see model for detail)
prm['tc_slope'] = 1e3
prm['tc_bias'] = 100
```

### Run the backtest

Pass the parameters and the data. Output is a dataframe with col:

- trade: number of shares/contracts to be bought (\>0) or sold (\<0)
- position: this is the target position for the next time period (here
  day)
- er: expected return for the next time interval (here day)
- vol: expected volatility for the next time interval (here day)
- pnl0: profit or loss for the time interval without TC (here day)
- pnl: profit or loss for the time interval including TC (here day)

``` python
bkt = backtest(df,prm)
print(bkt.tail())
```

Sample plot of the data:

``` python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

# Plot the data
plt.plot(bkt['pnl'].cumsum())

# Add labels and title
plt.xlabel('')
plt.ylabel('$')
plt.title('Performance')

# Show the plot
plt.show()
```
