# Moving average model

<!-- WARNING: THIS FILE WAS AUTOGENERATED! DO NOT EDIT! -->

To illustrate a backtesting algorithm, a simple prediction algorithm is
presented. Aside from the simplicity of the prediction algorithm, it’s
assumed that predictions are made at the same frequency as the input
data.

To create an expected return (ER) model (forecasting model), data and
the exact data format are required. Here, both data and param are
assumed to be dictionaries, facilitating the development of complex
algorithms that require various data items.

The convention is that any ER will accept data and a param, and will
consistently generate an output dictionary with a “yHat” element and
possibly others that can be utilized in more complex algorithms (e.g.,
when creating allocation or risk).

### ma_model

>      ma_model (data, param)

\*Initialize the moving average (ma) class with data and parameters.

Parameters: - data: A DataFrame containing OHLCV (Open, High, Low,
Close, Volume) data. - param: A dictionary containing parameters ‘mawin’
(moving average window) and ‘sdwin’ (standard deviation window).\*

## Example

``` python
# Get data
from backtest_sample.data_interface import get_data
import_module = get_data()
df = import_module('BTC-USD').sim_data()
# Forecast
prm = {}
prm['mawin'] = 10
prm['sdwin'] = 30
yHat = ma_model(df.values,prm)
print(yHat.y_hat())
```
